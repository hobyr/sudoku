This is the section to list all the to-do items and the description of this project.

Description
-----------

This project is a sudoku solver, coded by me. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills as well as my coding skills. I think I'll try first in Python since it's a simpler language with which I'm more at ease. Then I want to try in C++.

The goal here is not to have the most efficient solving algorithm, this will come later as I get a proper solution for sudoku solving.

So far, I need to brainstorm the possibilities to solve sudokus and figure out the flow to get from the unsolved to solved status.

To-do
-----

- [ ] Brainstorm ideas about sudoku solving
- [ ] Figure out the different workflows
- [ ] Try to implement the code for the imagined solutions/workflows
